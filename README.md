I have developed a dynamic and responsive healthy diet recommendation website tailored to individual dietary preferences, caloric needs, activity levels, and health goals. The platform focuses on delivering personalized nutrition plans to promote better health and well-being. The front-end of the website is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience.It is fully responsive, ensuring that the layout adapts seamlessly across different devices, from desktops to tablets and smartphones. This allows users to access the platform and its features easily, no matter what device they are using.

The website allows users to input their personal details such as dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, vegetarian, omnivorous), daily caloric requirements, activity levels, and specific health objectives such as weight loss, muscle gain, or maintenance.

To enhance the accuracy and relevance of diet plans, the website integrates the Gemini API, which generates personalized meal recommendations based on user inputs.
